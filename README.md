project-template
================

template files for different project files.  
These files are only helpfull for scaffolding the new project.  
Every project type has it's own files in it's own branch (named after the project type).  
For example, if I want to start a new *wordpress* project, I should first checkout this project on the wordpress branch (`git checkout wordpress`) and copy all the files in that branch in my project's root folder.  

##DEFAULT
The files from this branch should be present in any project! (except for any *.md* files, of course!)
